        <p>Hello! I'm a User Experience Designer working on the Photoshop team at Adobe. <b>You can get in touch with me at oliviaharoldon@gmail.com.</b><br><br>

        I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico and moved to San Francisco for college, where I received my BFA from the Academy of Art. After school, I began working at Wix.com as a technical support representative. During my two years at Wix, I spent many hours speaking with users about their experience with the product—a DIY website builder—and in doing so, developed a keen interest in how users interact with software. <br><br>

        In 2013, I moved from California to New York and took a position at Aviary, a photo editing app for iOS and Android, building and managing their community support program. My role later expanded into developing beta tests and conducting user research. At Aviary, I learned how software is developed from the ground up which sparked my interest in becoming more deeply involved in the design process. I shadowed our designer, took some classes at NYU, studied in my free time and eventually transitioned into a full time Product Design position. During this time (in 2014) Aviary was acquired by Adobe. <br><br>

        In 2016 I joined the Photoshop team where I've been focused on Photoshop for the iPad. In my spare time, you can find me hanging out with my husband, baby son and our dog, reading or listening to audio books and painting on my iPad Pro.
